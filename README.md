# React-Native-App
The React Native Mobile App developed in third year Cross-Platform Development in my Computer Science Degree. The idea of the app was to enable vegans to find nearby restaurants with good vegan options based on the suggestions/reviews submitted by fellow vegans. The design phase was a key focus in this module as the design of the app followed the 5 planes of UX. The completed app allows user to see a feed of highly rated vegan meals as well as being able to take a picture of a dish and submit a review. This repository contains the designs made prior and during development, the app files, and the report written on the iterative process of design and development. A 1st class was achieved in this module.
